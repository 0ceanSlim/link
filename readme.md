## Go Framework for Nostr Web Clients

A lightweight, extensible micro-framework for building Nostr clients using Go. This framework allows users to interact with the Nostr protocol, send notes and view profiles and relays. It’s designed for developers with experience in Go and web development, offering a foundation that’s easy to customize and expand.

## Features

- Send Kind 1 Notes: Send Nostr Kind 1 notes easily using the built-in form.
- View Latest Notes: Displays the user’s latest notes, fetched from connected relays in real-time.
- Profile Viewing: View user profile information such as display name, picture, and a brief description.
- Relay Viewing: Displays a list of user relays categorized as read, write, or both.
- Built-In Themes: Comes with 5 pre-configured themes for easy UI customization.
- Login with NIP-07 or Nsec Bunker: Supports authentication through NIP-07 browser extension or Nsec Bunker.
- Dynamic Updates with HTMX and Hyperscript: Uses HTMX for dynamic page updates and Hyperscript for client-side interactions, offering a smooth user experience without full page reloads.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Go (Golang)
- Frontend: HTML templates with Tailwind CSS for styling.
- HTMX: For dynamic updates of page sections, such as refreshing notes after a new one is sent.
- Hyperscript: Enhances client-side interactions with minimal JavaScript for handling user actions.
